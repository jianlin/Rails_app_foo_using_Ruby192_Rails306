this project is created using

  rails new foo

using Ruby 1.9.2-p180 and Rails 3.0.6 on a Macbook running Snow Leopard with 
RVM.

to make the files easy to compare with other projects created by different
versions of Rails, the name "foo" is used, instead of "ruby192_rails306", so
that there is as little diff as possible when diff'ing with other Rails 
projects.
